  "description": "Good morning, Gus. From Thunderbird Coffee on Manor, ANMA is back with another episode. Gus & Geoff take you back to their early website days with their pre-RT pages, talk about attending E3 2001, and the perils of Rainey st in the early 2000s. They also review the coffee in this one. Can't believe it."
